# Twitter Likes Exporter

Hacky Python scripts for downloading your Twitter likes and converting to HTML. Includes support for downloading user
avatars and image media in tweets. Scrapes tweets using the GraphQL API powering Twitter.com - the equivalent of you
scrolling through all your likes in your web browser, only saved locally forever!

Note only currently supports grabbing the liked tweet. So if it was a quote tweet, does not download the RT'd tweet. If
it's a reply or part of a thread, does not download the other tweets.

Meant to jumpstart you to at least getting your tweets offline from Twitter, if not building something much better!

## Setup

Intended for use with Python 3.7. First install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(It's just `requests`). Next you'll need to populate the `config.json` file with credentials needed to match how your
web browser gets your likes from Twitter.com:

1. Open up your web browser and ensure the Network web debugging tab is open so you can inspect network requests
2. Navigate to `https://twitter.com/<your_user_handle>/likes`
3. Look for a network request to an `api.twitter.com` domain path ending in `/Likes`
4. From the request headers:
    1) Copy the `Authorization` value and save as `HEADER_AUTHORIZATION` in `config.json`
    2) Copy the `Cookies` value and save as `HEADER_COOKIES` in `config.json`
    3) Copy the `x-csrf-token` value and save as `HEADER_CSRF` in `config.json`
   * You may have to replace quotation marks in your request header items with escaped quotations 
(ex. `"EXAMPLE": "SOMETHING "QUOTED"", ` needs to become `"EXAMPLE": "SOMETHING \"QUOTED\"", `)
   * If you get the error `json.decoder.JSONDecodError: Expecting ',' delimiter line XXX column YYY (char ZZZ)`, you are
likely missing a comma at the end of one of the lines of your config.json files. 
5. Find your Twitter user ID (NOT username) and save as `USER_ID` in `config.json`
    1) Can be found in the `/Likes` request params
    2) Alternatively, go to `https://commentpicker.com`, and type in your username.

### Download Likes to JSON

By default, liked tweets will be saved to a file `liked_tweets.json` in this repo's folder path. If you'd like to
override this, set new path as `OUTPUT_JSON_FILE_PATH` in `config.json`.

Run as follows:

```bash
python download_tweets.py
```

Should provide output like the following:

```bash
Starting retrieval of likes for Twitter user 1234...
Fetching likes page: 1...
Fetching likes page: 2...
Fetching likes page: 3...
Done. Likes JSON saved to: liked_tweets.json
```

The output JSON will be a list of dictionaries like the following:

```json
[
  {
    "tweet_id": "780770946428829696",
    "user_id": "265447323",
    "user_handle": "LeahTiscione",
    "user_name": "Leah Tiscione",
    "user_avatar_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1563330281838284805/aUtIY2vj_normal.jpg",
    "tweet_content": "What are you hiding in your locked instagram? sandwiches? Sunsets???? let us see your nephew!!!!",
    "tweet_media_urls": [],
    "tweet_created_at": "Sun Mar 13 15:16:45 +0000 2011"
  }
]
```

### Convert JSON Likes to HTML

If you want your tweets as a local HTML file, you can run the second script to convert the output JSON file from the
above step.

NOTE: This will attempt to download all media images and tweet author avatars locally by default to avoid relying on
Twitter hosting. You can override this by changing the `DOWNLOAD_IMAGES` boolean in `config.json` to `false`.

1. Be sure the `OUTPUT_JSON_FILE_PATH` value in `config.json` is pointing to the output JSON file of your tweets.
2. Run:

```bash
python parse_tweets_json_to_html.py
```

This will download all images (if specified; saved to `tweet_likes_html/images`) and construct an HTML file
at `tweet_likes_html/index.html` containing all liked tweets, as well as individual HTML files
within `tweet_likes_html/tweets/`.
